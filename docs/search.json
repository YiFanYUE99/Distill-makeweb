At the same time, I am adept at using R and python to process data. Although I have no article published yet, I have learnt how to draw most of the metabolomics plots in R and I am familiar with Python package Sklearn. Thus, I can build simple machine learning modern, such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine. These skills may be useful in future scientific research.\r\nBesides, I have a good command of dealing with HNMR data and I know a bit about using packages like tidymass and XCMS to cope with mass spectrometry data.\r\nI am currently writing a review on the relationship between gut microbiota and early exposure to environmental pollutants in life.\r\nAlso, I have the basic experiment skills like anatomizing of mice and zebrafish.\r\nMy Tofel score is 103. Thus, there‚Äôs no need to worry about whether I can converse with others normally in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
